            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bon Marché, San Francisco, USA.</h1><p>Among the eateries revitalising San Francisco's once-gritty Mid-Market neighborhood into the city's most buzzy food and drinks corridor is Bon Marché, a sunny Californian take on Le Marais. This 7500-square-foot space combines a café, a brewery, an oyster bar, a full-service restaurant, and even a flower shop that doubles as a stage for live jazz at night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f67536b56e8543128b8b1122f673dc5d50a01f50.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book's Brand New Update</h1><p>There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett. The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1d32105a54d9d89e483ba0384354f52d2dcf9ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
